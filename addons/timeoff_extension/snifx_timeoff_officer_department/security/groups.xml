        Group is functional without category_id.
        Accessible via:
        1. Time Off (Extra) dropdown field in Access Rights tab
        2. Officer Assignments tab (auto-assignment)
        
        Not showing as checkbox prevents duplicate UI.

Time Off Officer with department-based access control:
- View and approve leave requests for assigned department trees ONLY
- View balance reports for assigned departments
- View all employees (limited to Resume and Work Information tabs)
- View public holidays (READ-ONLY - cannot create/edit/delete)
- Cannot approve their own leave requests
- Flexible assignment to multiple department trees

Note: This group uses custom permission checking instead of standard inheritance
to maintain strict department-based access control via record rules.

Public Holiday Management: 
- Only Administrators and Managers can access Public Holidays management menu
- Officers can see holidays in calendar/dashboard but cannot manage them

Assignment: Use Settings > Users > [User] > Officer Assignments tab OR
use the "Time Off (Extra)" dropdown in Access Rights tab to assign this group.
